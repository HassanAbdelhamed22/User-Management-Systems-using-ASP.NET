# User Management System

This project was developed during my internship at Saib Bank. It is a comprehensive user management system built using ASP.NET Web Forms, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and ADO.NET. The system includes features such as smart login and registration, session-based role management, data management via Excel uploads, and profile management for both users and admins.

## Features

### Smart Login and Registration
- **Email, Password, and Phone Validation** during registration.
- **Session-based Role Management**: Redirects admins and users to respective pages based on their roles.

### Admin Capabilities
- **Excel Upload**: Admins can upload Excel files containing CRN, Agent Name, and Reason Type.
- **Data Management**: Admins can delete, edit, and update records seamlessly.
- **Duplicate Handling**: If a CRN already exists, the data is updated; if not, it's inserted into the database.

### User Features
- **CRN Search**: Users can search by CRN. If it exists, the record appears; otherwise, a "CRN did not exist" message is shown.
- **Profile Management**: Both users and admins can update their profiles and passwords.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Web Forms**
- **MySQL**
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**
- **ADO.NET**
